                    <p>   
                        Hello and welcome to my portfolio,  My name is Sutton, I am currently attending North Idaho college for an Associates degree in Computer Science. 
                        With my Associates degree I am planning on attending the University of Idaho where I will earn my Bachellor's degree in Computer Science.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ever since I was young I was always fascinated by the inner workings of computers, programs, and video games. 
                        At North Idaho College I have learned much about how computers work and how programs are able to run on them.
                        My classes have also taught me very important skills in the field such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Debugging</li>
                            <li>Communication</li>
                            <li>Problem solving</li>
                        </ul>
                        Over my time at NIC I have completed many different projects of varying complexity.

                    <h2>Battle Ship</h2>
                    <p>
                        My first major project was Battle Ship.  Battle Ship first introduced me to the game loop: Update, Render, Display.
                        My Partner and I worked our way through it pretty fast and were able to incorporate color.  The program features: a simple computer opponent,
                        random placement of ships, manual placement of ships, and hit and miss detection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was really fun as we were able to apply most of what we learned during the semester to making the game.  
                    </p>

                    <h2>Pac-man</h2>
                        <p>
                            I believe my most impressive project yet is Pac-man.  Me and my two partners remade Pac-man in C++ from scratch.
                            we had only recently learned how to incorporate graphics into a program and had not gone over features that would be important to the game such as
                            hitboxes, audio, pathfinding, and animations.  However using resources we found online going in depth into the pathfinding as well as some thinking outside of the box
                            we were able to solve all of these issues in the final weeks before the project was due.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project had a rocky start and may not be perfect but it had taught me to have a roadmap in mind for what features would be necessary
                            instead of just working on random bits and pieces throughout the game.

                    <h2>16 bit Minecraft Calculator</h2>
                        <p>
                            I am a big fan on Minecraft.  Recently there has been a new wave of Minecraft players who have been building computers and simple programs within minecraft.
                            Watching these videos inspired me to create a 16 bit calculator inside of Minecraft capable of calculating values from -32,768 to 32,767.  This project was fun to build and plan.  The most tricky part was
                            fitting all the blocks and trying to make it look nice.
                        </p>
